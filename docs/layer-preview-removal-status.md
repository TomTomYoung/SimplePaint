# Layer Preview Removal Status

## Completed
- Removed the thumbnail canvases from the layer list rendering logic while keeping layer metadata (name, size, type) intact.
- Simplified the CSS grid layout so rows no longer reserve space for the old preview column yet still show sliders, blend modes, and clip toggles.
- Updated the engine/manager flows to stop enqueueing thumbnail refreshes after layer operations.
- Added regression coverage that asserts layer rows render without `<canvas>` elements and that action controls remain attached to the panel.
- Added regression coverage that the layer filter/search controls, add buttons, and layer property form elements all remain wired to the DOM after the preview removal.

## Progress Log
- Confirmed automated regression protection for the layer list controls (`layer-filter`, search field, add/delete/vector buttons) so that removing previews no longer drops surrounding UI.
- Verified via regression tests that the layer properties footer (type label plus vector style controls) persists while rendering layers without previews.

## Remaining Verification
- Confirm visually that the layer filter buttons, search field, and add/delete controls stay visible in the live UI after removing previews.
- Monitor future feature work for references to the removed preview helpers to prevent reintroducing stale calls.

## Next Steps
- Manually open the layer panel in the application to double-check the controls listed above stay rendered.
- Expand automated regression coverage if any additional UI regressions are discovered during manual verification.
